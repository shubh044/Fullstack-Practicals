        <p>Front-end web development is everything involved in programming the user interface of a web application. Typically it refers to the Hypertext Markup Language(HTML), Cascading Style Sheets(CSS) and JavaScript portion of web site production as opposed to the database or server-side programming. It encompasses everything from building a simple page of HTML text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accesses via various different browsers, devices and screen sizes.</p>
